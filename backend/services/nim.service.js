    ── Task ──
    Evaluate if this announcement reinforces or breaks the Investment Thesis provided.
    If no thesis is provided, use general high-quality micro-cap/mid-cap growth investing principles.

    - If the news significantly advances, accelerates, or protects the investment thesis, it is POSITIVE.
    - If it introduces a structural risk, delay, or invalidates a core thesis assumption, it is NEGATIVE.
    - If it is routine compliance or minor news with no thesis impact, it is NEUTRAL.
    - Be decisive. Only use NEUTRAL if there is truly no impact on the thesis.
    - IMPORTANT: If the announcement is an Earnings Release/Financial Result, you MUST evaluate its numbers and margins against the investment thesis.

    ── Strict Content Rules (Zero Boilerplate) ──
    1. ABSOLUTELY FORBID generic fluff or empty advice such as "Investors should review the results to assess progress", "The company's performance is key", "Check the details to decide". This is useless and forbidden.
    2. DETECT SCANNED/EMPTY FILINGS: If the Announcement Text below contains NO actual numbers, details, or outcomes (e.g., it is just a brief intimation of a future meeting or the text is empty/unreadable), your summary MUST explicitly state: "No detailed figures or outcomes are available in this filing (scanned PDF or routine intimation only)." In this case, DO NOT make up generic thesis alignment fluff.
    3. FACTUAL SUMMARY & VERDICT: Your summary must be 2-3 highly analytical sentences. Sentence 1: Factual operational/financial event (with exact figures: ₹Cr, %, margins if available). Sentence 2: Explicit verdict on whether the results/news are overall good (strong growth/expansion), flat/neutral, or bad (contraction/weakness) relative to expectations/thesis, and the main driver. Sentence 3: Specific business impact and concrete actionable implication for the investor.

    ── Priority Rules ──
    HIGH: Earnings Results / Financial Results, Large orders (>10% of annual revenue), M&A / demergers / restructuring, management/auditor exits, capex >20% net worth, credit downgrades, regulatory actions, Product Approvals, Patents, Licenses, Large contract wins, Awards, MOU signings with strategic partners.
    MEDIUM: Dividends, board meeting notices, credit rating reaffirmations, allotments, medium-sized orders, general business updates, scheduled earnings conference calls / concalls.
    LOW: Routine compliance filings, share certificate loss, voting results, AGM notices, window closure notices, newspaper publications.
    LOW (ALWAYS, NO EXCEPTIONS): Postal ballot notices, AGM/EGM notices, director re-appointment notices, commission to non-executive directors, shareholders meeting notices, newspaper publication intimations, voting results, scrutinizer reports, compliance certificates, board meeting notices that do NOT announce actual financial results. Private analyst/investor meets, one-on-one meetings with mutual funds or institutional investors, management interaction meetings, analyst roadshows, investor days organized by brokers, fund house meetings. These do NOT move the share price and must ALWAYS be classified LOW NEUTRAL regardless of any other content.

    ── Output Rules ──
    - "summary": A 2-3 sentence factual summary that starts with an explicit qualitative verdict (overall strong/good, flat, or weak/bad) and provides a high-level overview of the key numbers and business drivers.
    - "key_data": Extract ALL specific numbers — order value (₹Cr), acquisition cost, capex outlay, revenue %, deal tenure, capacity. If none, write "No specific figures disclosed."
    - "deep_dive_indicator": Name the precise investment thesis risk or opportunity with context.
    - "result_date": YYYY-MM-DD if a board meeting for results is announced. Otherwise null.
    - "is_earnings_release": true ONLY when the filing contains actual quarterly or annual financial numbers (revenue, PAT, EBITDA figures). Postal ballot notices, director re-appointments, AGM/EGM notices, commission approvals, and newspaper publications are ALWAYS is_earnings_release: false, NO EXCEPTIONS — even if the word "results" appears in the text.
    - "concall_date": YYYY-MM-DD if a scheduled or rescheduled earnings conference call is mentioned. Otherwise null.
    - "concall_time": HH:MM IST/format or null if a scheduled or rescheduled earnings conference call time is mentioned (e.g. "16:00 IST"). Otherwise null.
    - "is_rescheduled": true if the earnings conference call is explicitly rescheduled, postponed, or revised from a previous date. Otherwise false.
    - "is_agm": true if the filing is an AGM/EGM notice, proceedings, outcome, annual report, or postal ballot notice. Otherwise false.
    - "agm_status": "scheduled" if it is a notice/schedule for a future meeting, or "completed" if it is the proceedings/outcome of a meeting that has already occurred. Otherwise null.
    - "agm_highlights": A bulleted 2-4 point summary of key resolutions, management takeaways, or Q&A if agm_status is "completed". Otherwise null.

    Return ONLY a valid JSON object:
