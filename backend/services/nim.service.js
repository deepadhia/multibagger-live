    ── Task ──
    Evaluate if this announcement reinforces or breaks the Investment Thesis provided.
    If no thesis is provided, use general high-quality micro-cap/mid-cap growth investing principles.

    - If the news significantly advances, accelerates, or protects the investment thesis, it is POSITIVE.
    - If it introduces a structural risk, delay, or invalidates a core thesis assumption, it is NEGATIVE.
    - If it is routine compliance or minor news with no thesis impact, it is NEUTRAL.
    - Be decisive. Only use NEUTRAL if there is truly no impact on the thesis.
    - IMPORTANT: If the announcement is an Earnings Release/Financial Result, you MUST evaluate its numbers and margins against the investment thesis.

    ── Financial Data Precision & Extraction Rules ──
    1. MANDATORY YOY PRECEDENCE: YoY comparison (e.g. Q1 FY27 vs Q1 FY26) is MANDATORY and MUST take precedence over QoQ sequential comparisons. If PAT contracts YoY (> -10%) or EBITDA margin contracts YoY (> -200 bps), lead with this YoY contraction as the headline financial result. NEVER bury a YoY profit or margin decline behind a QoQ sequential recovery framing.
    2. PAT PRECISION: Always extract 'Net Profit for the period (PAT) attributable to Owners of the Company'. NEVER use intermediate pre-tax, pre-associate, or standalone line items when consolidated tables are present.
    3. MANDATORY EBITDA & MARGINS: For all Financial Results filings, ALWAYS extract or calculate EBITDA (Profit Before Tax + Finance Costs + Depreciation) and EBITDA Margin % (EBITDA / Revenue from Operations * 100). Always state EBITDA YoY % growth and EBITDA Margin bps change.
    4. SEGMENT RED FLAG DETECTION: Extract all segment-wise results (Revenue & EBIT) and explicitly highlight any segment experiencing a YoY revenue/EBIT decline > 20% as a Segment Red Flag (e.g. Segment A EBIT declining > 20% YoY). NEVER claim 'no red flags' when a major segment collapses YoY.
    5. MULTI-SEGMENT THESIS RESPECT: NEVER claim a company has single-segment operations or no diversification when the investment thesis or filing explicitly details multiple verticals (e.g., Real Estate + Data Center + Cloud Services under Ashok Cloud).
    6. ANTI-HALLUCINATION: NEVER report future quarter numbers (e.g. Q2 FY27) as actual achieved performance. Label any forward figure as 'Management Target/Guidance', never actuals.
    7. DYNAMIC UNIT NORMALIZATION ENGINE (Lakhs / Millions / Crores to Crores): Always check the table header for unit indicators such as '(₹ in Lakhs)', '(₹ in Millions)', '(₹ in Mn)', or '(₹ in Crores)'. Convert ALL absolute monetary values (Revenue, EBITDA, PAT) into standardized INR CRORES (₹ Cr):
       • If table is in '₹ in Lakhs': Divide all numbers by 100 to get ₹ Cr (e.g. 26,100 Lakhs = ₹261.0 Cr).
       • If table is in '₹ in Millions' / '₹ in Mn': Divide all numbers by 10 to get ₹ Cr (e.g. 16,938 Mn = ₹1,693.8 Cr, 2,564 Mn = ₹256.4 Cr).
       • If table is in '₹ in Crores': Keep as-is.
       • ALWAYS label monetary values with '₹ Cr' (e.g. 'Revenue: ₹1,693.8 Cr'). NEVER output raw unscaled Millions or Lakhs as Crores.

    ── Strict Content Rules (Zero Boilerplate) ──
    1. ABSOLUTELY FORBID generic fluff or empty advice such as "Investors should review the results to assess progress", "The company's performance is key", "Check the details to decide". This is useless and forbidden.
    2. DETECT SCANNED/EMPTY FILINGS: If the Announcement Text below contains NO actual numbers, details, or outcomes (e.g., it is just a brief intimation of a future meeting or the text is empty/unreadable), your summary MUST explicitly state: "No detailed figures or outcomes are available in this filing (scanned PDF or routine intimation only)." In this case, DO NOT make up generic thesis alignment fluff.
    3. FACTUAL SUMMARY & VERDICT: Your summary must be 2-3 highly analytical sentences. Sentence 1: Factual operational/financial event (with exact figures: Revenue ₹Cr, EBITDA ₹Cr & %, PAT ₹Cr & %). Sentence 2: Explicit verdict on whether the results/news are overall good (strong growth/expansion), flat/neutral, or bad (contraction/weakness) relative to expectations/thesis, and the main driver. Sentence 3: Specific business impact and concrete actionable implication for the investor.

    ── Priority Rules ──
    HIGH: Earnings Results / Financial Results, Large orders (>10% of annual revenue), M&A / demergers / restructuring, management/auditor exits, capex >20% net worth, credit downgrades, regulatory actions, Product Approvals, Patents, Licenses, Large contract wins, Awards, MOU signings with strategic partners.
    MEDIUM: Dividends, board meeting notices, credit rating reaffirmations, allotments, medium-sized orders, general business updates, scheduled earnings conference calls / concalls.
    LOW: Routine compliance filings, share certificate loss, voting results, AGM notices, window closure notices, newspaper publications.
    LOW (ALWAYS, NO EXCEPTIONS): Postal ballot notices, AGM/EGM notices, director re-appointment notices, commission to non-executive directors, shareholders meeting notices, newspaper publication intimations, voting results, scrutinizer reports, compliance certificates, board meeting notices that do NOT announce actual financial results. Private analyst/investor meets, one-on-one meetings with mutual funds or institutional investors, management interaction meetings, analyst roadshows, investor days organized by brokers, fund house meetings. These do NOT move the share price and must ALWAYS be classified LOW NEUTRAL regardless of any other content.

    ── Output Rules ──
    - "summary": A 2-3 sentence factual summary that starts with an explicit qualitative verdict (overall strong/good, flat, or weak/bad) and provides a high-level overview of the key numbers and business drivers.
    - "key_data": Extract ALL specific numbers — order value (₹Cr), acquisition cost, capex outlay, revenue %, deal tenure, capacity. If none, write "No specific figures disclosed."
    - "deep_dive_indicator": Name the precise investment thesis risk or opportunity with context.
    - "result_date": YYYY-MM-DD if a board meeting for results is announced. Otherwise null.
    - "is_earnings_release": true ONLY when the filing contains actual quarterly or annual financial numbers (revenue, PAT, EBITDA figures). Postal ballot notices, director re-appointments, AGM/EGM notices, commission approvals, and newspaper publications are ALWAYS is_earnings_release: false, NO EXCEPTIONS — even if the word "results" appears in the text.
    - "concall_date": YYYY-MM-DD if a scheduled or rescheduled earnings conference call is mentioned. Otherwise null.
    - "concall_time": HH:MM IST/format or null if a scheduled or rescheduled earnings conference call time is mentioned (e.g. "16:00 IST"). Otherwise null.
    - "is_rescheduled": true if the earnings conference call is explicitly rescheduled, postponed, or revised from a previous date. Otherwise false.
    - "is_agm": true if the filing is an AGM/EGM notice, proceedings, outcome, annual report, or postal ballot notice. Otherwise false.
    - "agm_status": "scheduled" if it is a notice/schedule for a future meeting, or "completed" if it is the proceedings/outcome of a meeting that has already occurred. Otherwise null.
    - "agm_highlights": A bulleted 2-4 point summary of key resolutions, management takeaways, or Q&A if agm_status is "completed". Otherwise null.
